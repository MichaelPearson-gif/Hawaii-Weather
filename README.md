# Hawaii-Weather
One place I have always wanted to visit on vacation was Hawaii. However, I would want to go when the weather is nice, so using an sqlite file on Hawaii's weather I analyzed it in Pandas and plotted the data in Matplotlib.
This way, I can see if the time frame I pick would be a good idea to go to Hawaii or not.
